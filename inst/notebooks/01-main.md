# Analysis of weather impact on people and the economy
Alfonso R. Reyes  



## Questions

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

## Synopsis
<ten sentences>
weather impact on the economy: property and crops.
Does not take into account other effects such as defferred revenue, no income,
Years recorded from 1950 till 2011.
Investigate how much is the impact of the weather
Impact on the popuplation: fatalities, injured.
For the 1st question we will use the variables: EVTYPE, FATALITIES and INJURIES.
For the 2nd question, we will use the variables: EVTYPE, PROPDMG, CROPDMG, PROPDMGEXP and CROPDMGEXP.
Other analysis can later be performed such as if the weather effects have been improving or worsening, what states have suffered the largest impact, what counties have the highest economic loss, etc.



## Data Processing
The data processing consists in the following steps:

1. Download the raw data file from the internet theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))using the `download.file` function.
2. Unpack the downloaded file (535+ MB) with the function `bunzip` into a CSV file named as `dataset.csv`.
3. Load the CSV file in the object `stormdata.raw`: 902,297 observations and 37 variables.
4. Perform a quick analysis of the dataset `stormdata.raw` before applying data transformations.
5. Create a simplified dataset `stormdata` where some non-relevant variables have been removed but all observations kept. 902,297 observations and 13 variables.
6. Create a small dataset `stormdata.small` with only 12 variables and all observations still in place. The variable `BGN_DATE` converted to date type and renamed to `DATE`. The size of this file `stormdata.small.rda` is around 6 MB.
7. Clear the object `stormdata.raw` to save memory. Use only the new and smaller data frame `stormdata`
8. Create the data frames to respond the first question.
9. Create the data frame to respond to the second question.
10. Save an additional dataset to address other questions in the future.

### Set up project folders with `rprojroot` package

```r
# package rprojroot required
root <- rprojroot::is_rstudio_project
root_file <- root$make_fix_file()
# root$find_file("REAME.md")
root_file()
cat("Setting up the project folders:\n")

project.extdata <- root_file("inst/extdata")
project.R <- root_file("R")

```


### Downloading the data
We found a problem while trying to download the data file from the internet. The `bunzip2` format is not properly managed by the `download.file` function. So, we have to add a new function `bunzip2` from the package `R.utils` to download and unpack the compresed file. Of course, this could have been done by using the `read.csv` function to read the data file directly but that would be a "one-off" operation. To make the function `downloadZip` reusable for the future we used `bunzip2`. There is a flag in the function that allows the selection of that particular compression format.


```r
downloadZip <- function(fileUrl, outDir="./data", bzip2 = FALSE) {
  # function to download zipped and bunzip2 files and unpack
  temp <- tempfile()
  download.file(fileUrl, temp, mode = "wb")
  if (bzip2 == FALSE) {
    unzip(temp, exdir = outDir)
  }
  else {
    destfile <- paste(outDir, "dataset.csv", sep = "/")  # provide a filename
    bunzip2(temp, destname = destfile, overwrite = TRUE) # unpack bunzip2 file
  }
}
```



```r
# URL of the dataset file
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"
cat("Unpacking the raw data file:\n")
```

```
Unpacking the raw data file:
```

```r
outDir <- project.extdata             # folder for raw data
downloadZip(fileUrl, outDir = outDir, bzip2 = TRUE)   # download and unpack file
```



```r
# read the CSV file to memory
dataFile <- paste(project.extdata, "dataset.csv", sep = "/")
stormdata.raw <- read.csv(dataFile)
# stormdata <- stormdata.raw          # for the moment we will use a shorter name
```

### How our raw data look?

```r
# properties of the dataset
dims <- dim(stormdata.raw)
```

There are 902297 observations and 37 variables.

The names of the variables are:

### What variables do we keep for our analysis?

These are the variable that we consider important for the analysis:

        REFNUM, BGN_DATE, STATE, COUNTY, COUNTYNAME, EVTYPE, 
        FATALITIES, INJURIES, PROPDMG, PROPDMGEXP, CROPDMG, CROPDMGEXP, REMARKS



```r

There is a typo in one of the observations in the California flood 2005/2006. We noticed this while plotting the economic impact of the weather events. This code below will filter the event that started on Christmas 2005 and persisted around 2006 New Year.

We are saving the correction in `stormdata.rda`. So, if the reader wants to reproduce the error, it wil be necessary to load the data from scratch, starting with downloading the file from the original source. The code above wll reproduce the steps necessary. To see the observation with the typo (it was writen "B" instead of "M" in the variable `PROPDMGEXP`), it corresponds to observation 605943 as identified by the variable `REFNUM`.



```r
# floods in California from Xmas 2005 to around New Year 2006
# one record improperly entered as Billions instead of millions REFNUM=605943
ca.flood <- stormdata %>%
  filter(DATE >= "2005-12-25" & DATE <= "2006-01-02" & STATE == "CA" & PROPDMG > 0) %>%
  arrange(DATE) %>%
  select(REFNUM, DATE, STATE, PROPDMG, PROPDMGEXP, CROPDMG, CROPDMGEXP, REMARKS)

as_data_frame(ca.flood)
```

### Clean up the dataset
We will transform the variable `BGN_DATE` from a factor to a date variable. We will later use it for our summaries. We will also take out some variables that are not relevant to our study.


```r
load(paste(project.data, "stormdata.rda", sep = "/"))  # load the data
```



```r
stormdata.small <- stormdata %>% 
  select(REFNUM, BGN_DATE, STATE, COUNTY, COUNTYNAME, EVTYPE, # take out
           FATALITIES, INJURIES, PROPDMG, PROPDMGEXP, CROPDMG, CROPDMGEXP) %>%
  mutate(DATE = mdy_hms(as.character(BGN_DATE))) %>%    # convert to date
  select(REFNUM, DATE, STATE, COUNTY, COUNTYNAME, EVTYPE,     # reorder
         FATALITIES, INJURIES, PROPDMG, PROPDMGEXP, CROPDMG, CROPDMGEXP) 
```

```

1 Hurricane Katrina was one of the strongest and most destructive hurricanes on record to impact the coast of the United States.  It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.\n\nDamage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.\n\nFatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating..\n Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. \n\nDue to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. \n\nThe highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. \n\nPost storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.   \n\nStorm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 7 to 14 inches with lower amounts observed farther west toward the Atchafalaya River.  A rainfall total of 11.63 inches was measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell.

Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations\n\nPost storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion.

was catastrophic and approached or exceeded the surge associated with Hurricane Camille and impacted a much more extensive area.  Almost total destruction was observed along the immediate coast in Hancock and Harrison Counties with storm surge damage extending north along bays and bayous to Interstate Highway 10 in some instances.  Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed by the storm surge. Most tide gages were destroyed by the storm surge so storm surge was determined primarily by post storm high water mark surveys conducted by FEMA. An estimated storm surge of approximately 23.0 feet occurred at the Hancock County EOC operations area in Waveland, and the high water mark measured on the Jackson County EOC building in Pascagoula was 16.1 feet.  Preliminary estimates of storm surge along the Mississippi Coast include Hancock County 19-25 ft, Harrison County 19-25 feet, Jackson County 17-21 ft. Wave action on top of the storm surge enhanced the damage in many area.  All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.

         Correct typo in property damage from 'B' (biilion) to 'M' (million).| Major flooding continued into the early hours of January 1st, before the Napa River finally fell below flood stage and the water receeded. Flooding was severe in Downtown Napa from the Napa Creek and the City and Parks Department was hit with $6 million in damage alone. The City of Napa had 600 homes with moderate damage, 150 damaged businesses with costs of at least $70 million.

### Saving a portion of the dataset
If we save the data frame `stormdata` as an .rda file the size is 46 megabytes. On the other hand, if we omit the `REMARKS` variable, the new dataset shrinks to only 4.6 megabytes. We will take this route of saving the smaller file.


```r
# save unique events by year
save(stormdata.small, file = paste(project.data, "stormdata.small.rda", sep = "/"))
```

```
Error in save(stormdata.small, file = paste(project.data, "stormdata.small.rda", : object 'stormdata.small' not found
```


### The recorded weather events
Event Types `EVTYPE`


```r
# want to know how many levels this factor has
as_data_frame(unique(stormdata$EVTYPE), 10)
```

```
Warning in as.data.frame.factor(value, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, ...):

an error!

There are 985 different type of events.

### Create data frames for 1st question
We want to find now which type of events is more harmful to population health. We could group by `EVTYPE` and showing the variables FATALITIES and INJURIES.


```r

  arrange(desc(fatal.sum), desc(injur.sum))

byEvent.0

We plot now the top 5 events that cause more harm on the population:


```r
byEvent.005 <- byEvent.0[1:5, ]

p1 <- ggplot(byEvent.005, aes(x = reorder(EVTYPE, -fatal.sum), y = fatal.sum)) +

Tornados, Excessive heat, flash floods, heat and lightning are the weather events most harmful to the population accross the United States.

## Assessing the Economic Damage
The property and crop damage are not in a unique monetary units; they use thousands, millions and billions. They are specified in the variables `PROPDMGEXP` and `CROPDMGEXP`.

We will start by converting the monetary damages to a consistent units. We will choose thousands.


```r
byDamage <- stormdata %>%
  select(EVTYPE, PROPDMG, PROPDMGEXP, CROPDMG, CROPDMGEXP) %>%
  group_by(EVTYPE) %>%
  mutate(PROPDMGEXP = as.factor(toupper(str_trim(PROPDMGEXP))),      # clean the string
         CROPDMGEXP = as.factor(toupper(str_trim(CROPDMGEXP)))) %>%
  mutate(PROPDMG.K = ifelse(PROPDMGEXP == "K", PROPDMG * 1,
                     ifelse(PROPDMGEXP == "M", PROPDMG * 1000,
                     ifelse(PROPDMGEXP == "B", PROPDMG * 1E6, 0)))) %>%
  mutate(CROPDMG.K = ifelse(CROPDMGEXP == "K", CROPDMG * 1,
                     ifelse(CROPDMGEXP == "M", CROPDMG * 1000,
                     ifelse(CROPDMGEXP == "B", CROPDMG * 1E6, 0))))

### Multiple identifiers for monetary units
There are some unspecified units in `PROPDMGEXP` and `CROPDMGEXP`.
There is no a reasonable way to determine the units or damage value from the remarks. Sometimes is thousands or in 10K, or other. Besides the identifiers `B`, `M` and `K`, there are additional characters and numbers entered in this variable. Since there is no way to etermine the units for the property or crop damage we are not considering these amounts. In two cases, we found that instead of "M" for millions the lowercase version of it "m" was used. We converted them to uppercase before summarizing the data.

Other characters or digits did not bring a special meaning to the dollar amount, so we didn't convert them even thoiugh we read the remarks to find some relationship.

Here is how we know how many observations do not carry the "K", "M" and "B" identifiers.


```r
unknown <- stormdata %>%
  select(STATE, EVTYPE, PROPDMGEXP, CROPDMGEXP, REMARKS) %>%
  filter(!toupper(PROPDMGEXP) %in% c("K", "M", "B") | !toupper(CROPDMGEXP) %in% c("K", "M", "B"))
```

There are 622760 observations which dollar amount units are not properly identified in `PROPDMGEXP` and `CROPDMGEXP` variables.


### Preparing the data for other questions
We save few datasets that are much smaller in size than the original dataset.

1. byYearEvent: is a dataset that contains a summary of the events, fatalities, injuries, economic losses in property and crops in millions of US$. TO-DO: convert dates to year.

2. byYearSummary: a dataset showing the year and the wather impact on life and the economy. Four variables: year, fatalities, injured and economy losses in millions of USD.


```r
# By year, by event
byYearEvent <- stormdata %>%
  group_by(BGN_DATE, EVTYPE) %>%
  mutate(PROPDMGEXP = as.factor(toupper(str_trim(PROPDMGEXP))), 
         CROPDMGEXP = as.factor(toupper(str_trim(CROPDMGEXP))))     %>%
  mutate(PROPDMG.K = ifelse(PROPDMGEXP == "K", PROPDMG * 1,
                     ifelse(PROPDMGEXP == "M", PROPDMG * 1000,
                     ifelse(PROPDMGEXP == "B", PROPDMG * 1E6, 0)))) %>%
  mutate(CROPDMG.K = ifelse(CROPDMGEXP == "K", CROPDMG * 1,
                     ifelse(CROPDMGEXP == "M", CROPDMG * 1000,
                     ifelse(CROPDMGEXP == "B", CROPDMG * 1E6, 0)))) %>%
  summarize(fatalities = sum(FATALITIES), 
            injuries   = sum(INJURIES),
            propdmg.M  = sum(PROPDMG.K) / 1000,
            cropdmg.M  = sum(CROPDMG.K) /1000
            )
```

```
Error in resolve_vars(new_groups, tbl_vars(.data)): unknown variable to group by : BGN_DATE

### Have the number of fatalities and injuries increased over the years?


```r
#load(paste(project.data, "byYearEvent.rda", sep = "/"))  # load the data

byYearSummary <- byYearEvent %>%
  mutate(year = year(mdy_hms(as.character(BGN_DATE)))) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(fatalities = sum(fatalities), 
            injuries = sum(injuries),
            damage.mm = sum(propdmg.M) + sum(cropdmg.M),
            damage.bb = damage.mm / 1000) %>%
  arrange(desc(damage.bb))
```

```
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'byYearEvent' not found
```

```r
byYearSummary
```

```
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'byYearSummary' not found
```

There are two years with the most economic damage: 2006 and 2005.



```r
q1 <- ggplot(byYearSummary, aes(x = year, y = damage.bb)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Impact on economy 1950-2011") + 
  labs(y = "Billions US$") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

```

```r
q2 <- ggplot(byYearSummary, aes(x = year, y = fatalities)) +

  ggtitle("impact on human life, 1950-2011") +
  labs(y = "Fatalities") +

## Results
<present the results here>
These are the results:

1. Tornados, Excessive heat, flash floods, heat and lightning are the weather events most harmful to the population accross the United States.

2. In the case of injuries caused to humans tornados, excessive heat, lightning, heat and flash floods are the events causing them in descending order.

3. On the economic impact, we classified the weather events from the most damaging to the economy to the less. They are: flood, hurricane/typhoon, tornados, storm surge, hail, flash flodd, drought, river flood and ice storms. The economic impact totals both, property and crops.

4. Other additional findings were that the weather events have been increasing its damage to the economy and for the population in general. From the plots, we can see that from 1992 onwards, the effects have been disastrous. The losses in the economic have ascended from few millions to tens or hundreds of billions! On the population we can appreciate an increase in mortality from about a hundred in average until the end of the 80s to five hundred to fifteen hundred fatalities. 

5. Injuries have had less devastating effect but has not duplicated or triplicated as in the economy or mortality. Additional studies may be advisable to find the reason to the control in injuries in humans because of the weather events. We can notice some cyclical shape on the injuries accross the years but the slope is mildly ascending.

6. There are a couple of major weather events in 2005 and 2006 where we can see a drastic impact on the economy of 100 and 125 billion dollars. One was Katrina affecting several states in the Southm, and the other was a major flood in California.
